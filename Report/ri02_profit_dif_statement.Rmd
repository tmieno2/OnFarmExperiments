For Zone _insert-zone-here_, the best estimate of the gain in net revenues when switching from the growerâ€™s chosen rate of `r get_input(opt_gc_data, "gc", _insert-zone-here_)` _unit_here_ per acre to the recommended rate of `r get_input(opt_gc_data, "opt_v", _insert-zone-here_)` _unit_here_ would have been approximately $`r get_pi_dif(pi_dif_test_zone, _insert-zone-here_)`, as is shown by the height of the red circle.  The black brackets centered over Zone _insert-zone-here_'s red circle illustrates that a 95% level of statistical confidence that the difference in net revenues would have been between `r get_pi_ci_zone(pi_dif_test_zone, _insert-zone-here_)`. A t-test _t-confidence-statement_ level of statistical confidence that net revenues would be greater at the `r get_input(opt_gc_data, "opt_v", _insert-zone-here_)` _unit_here_ rate than at the grower-chosen rate of `r get_input(opt_gc_data, "gc", _insert-zone-here_)` _unit_here_ (t-value of `r get_t_value(pi_dif_test_zone, _insert-zone-here_)`).
