Figure \@ref(fig:profit-dif-map) shows the estimate of the gain in per-acre net revenues that would have resulted in each of the observation units from following the estimated economically optimal Rx rather than the commercial Rx.  (Net revenues equal revenues from _crop_type_here_ sales minus _input_full_name_l_ costs.) The estimated average per-acre gain from managing the observation units optimally instead of following the commerical Rx was  `r whole_profits_test[type_short == "ovg", point_est_dif] %>% round(digits = 2)`. Of course, as with any statistical data analysis, there cannot be 100% certainty that the actual net revenues from the two management plans would end up being exactly `r whole_profits_test[type_short == "ovg", point_est_dif] %>% round(digits = 2)` The black bracket centered over the red circle in Figure \@ref(fig:whole-field-profit-comp) shows the range of net revenues that the data and model predict are “95% certain” to contain the true net revenues that would come about if the strategies we to be implemented again, given the growing season's actual weather conditions. A formal statistical test (called a t-test) established with a _stat_confidence_here_ level of statistical confidence that net revenues would indeed be greater from following the estimated optimal Rx rather than the commercial Rx.
