Figure \@ref(fig:tgti-yield-ap) displays the trial design and the resultant _asa-or-asp_ map.  Casual observation shows that <!--NEED to determine and assign:  "trial implementation was basically accurate", or "the accuracy of trial implementation was limited by" (add text by hand) -->.  

The field's status quo _seeding-or-application_ plan (that is, the one that would have been used had there been no field trial conducted) was to _grower-plan-here_.  

Plots were all `r plot_width` feet wide.  Plot were all between <!--shortest_plot_length_hereK--> and <!--longest_plot_length_hereK-->feet long. A rate of <!--buffer_zone_rate_hereK--> per acre was assigned to a buffer zone around the perimeter of the trial, but observations from the buffer zone were not included as part of the trial in later analysis. Figure \@ref(fig:tgti-yield-ap) pairs the trial's design, _asa-or-asp_, and yield maps. 

```{r tgti-yield-ap, fig.cap = "Trial design, _asa-or-asp_ rates, and yields, 2020)", fig.height = ifelse(w_trial_info$use_td, 5, 10)}
